# 0x1A Application Server
Welcome to the "0x1A Application Server" repository! This project focuses on setting up, configuring, and managing an application server, which is a critical component in serving dynamic web applications. An application server bridges the gap between a web server and your applicationâ€™s backend, processing requests and delivering content to users.

## Overview
In this project, you will learn how to deploy an application server, configure it to handle web traffic, and ensure that it works seamlessly with your web server (such as Nginx or Apache). The project also covers the use of different application server software, how to integrate it with your web stack, and how to manage its performance and security.
