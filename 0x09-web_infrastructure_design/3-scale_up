You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

- For every additional element, why you are adding it

• 1 server

We added another server to reduce the load on our current servers.

• 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one

We added the Load balancer to distribute the requests between the Web server, Application server and Database Server..


• Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server

With this configuration, there will be an increase in performance since each server will be optimized for its specific workload.

Also, If one server experiences a failure or becomes overloaded, it's less likely to impact the functionality of the other server, ensuring better fault tolerance.
