You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

For every additional element, why you are adding it?

- 3 firewalls

These firewalls protects the 3 servers from unauthorized users.

- 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS

This SSL certificate tells Users that they can trust foobar.com. And that certificate encryptes all the data exchanged between the User and foobar.com.

- 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)

This program is a monitoring client. It monitors our servers.

- What are firewalls for?

Firewalls protects servers, by terminating connection attempts to the servers based on already set criterias.
This could be based on certain IP addresses or other criterias.

- Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?

It is served over HTTPS to ensure that data  between Users and foobar.com is secured.

- What monitoring is used for?

It is used to monitor our servers performance, security, Capacity and Availability. It is essential to identify issues, and make informed decisions to improve performance, availability, and security. 

- How the monitoring tool is collecting data?

It collects data with Agent-Based monitoring or Agent-Less monitoring.

- Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS

If you want to monitor your web server QPS, you need to install a monitoring tool that supports monitoring web servers and provides QPS metrics.


You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

- Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue?

It is an issue because

• When data is decrypted at the Load Balancer, The encryption ends there. This means that the traffic between the load balancer and other servers is transmitted in plain text, which could potentially expose sensitive data to interception or eavesdropping.

• When data is decrypted and re-encrypted at the Load balancer, it consumes more CPU resource and potentially impact performance.

- Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?

A single MySQL server may not be able to handle high write loads efficiently, leading to performance bottlenecks and degraded performance as the workload increases.

- Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem?

Running multiple components on the same server can result in contention for resources such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O.

Also, performing maintenance or upgrade on such servers will be complex and risky.
