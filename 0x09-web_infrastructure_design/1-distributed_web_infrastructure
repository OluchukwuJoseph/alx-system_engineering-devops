You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

- For every additional element, why you are adding it.

	• 2 more server
	• 1 load balancer
	• 1 Application server
	• 1 Web server
	• 1 set of application files

One of the servers will host our Application files and run the Web server and Application server in case of Planned or Unplanned downtime while the other will host our Load Balancer.

The load-balancer will distribute load between the servers based on certain criterias.

• 1 database

This database was added as a Replica to our main database to increase performance by reducing stress on our primary database and it also serves as Backup to our primary database.

- What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works?

It is configured with the Weighted Round Robin Algorithm.

This is how it works:

First, the weight of each server has to be set. The weight simply means how much workload each server can handle.
This technique distributes incoming requests among both servers based on their assigned weights. The Servers with higher weight receives more requests than the servers with lower weight, effectively balancing the workload.
                                                                                                                                     Once a server's weight is reached, the algorithm moves on to the next server, ensuring fair distribution of requests based on server capacity.

- Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup? Explain the difference between both.

It enables an Active-Active setup.
                                                                                                                                     An Active-Active setup is the kind where all servers handle requests simultaneously. This setup provides higher scalability, availability, and performance since all servers are utilized efficiently.
Active-Active setups are commonly used in high-traffic environments or for applications requiring continuous availability.

While an Active-Passive setup is the one where while one server (or a subset of servers) is handling requests, the others remains idle until needed.                                                                                                                      Active-Passive setups are typically used for applications where immediate failover capability is critical, but where the additional capacity of the passive servers is not required during normal operation.

- How does a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works?

In the Primary-Replica cluster, we have one Primary Database (The master) that can perform CRUD operations, and we have Replica databases which Replicates all operations done on the primary database,                                                                   They typically serve read operations to offload the primary database and improve performance and depending on the configuration, replica databases can replicate synchronously or asynchronously.

- What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application?
                                                                                                                                     The application will connect to the Primary node (database) for Write, Update and Delete operations and it will connect to the Replica node (database) for READ operations.
                                                                                                                                     You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

- SPOF

This design has one load balancer and that can be a Point Of Failure, because the load-balancer like any other component in a system might crash, due to hardware failures, software bugs, misconfigurations, network issues, or even distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

- Security issues
                                                                                                                                     This infrastructure doesn't have a firewall or  HTTPS, thus Hackers (or other attackers)  can infiltrate the system and manipulate data being sent to them by Users and to Users by them.

- No Monitoring

This infrastructure doesn't have any monitoring software, thus it cannot be improved because "Anything that cannot be monitored cannot be improved".
